# Python_Apps


**This repository consists of applications that I made to practise Python programming.**




## List of contents:


**1. Network Scanner**

  User inputs IP address as a target.
  The app scans the target, prints open ports as output.
  If open port SSH is found on target it asks if user wants to start bruteforcing against it.
  App bruteforces the SHH on target using username provided by user and password from a file.
  If connection is succesful it opens command line on target and allows to execute code.

**2. TheHangMan**

  Classic hangman word game.
  App randomly chooses a word from the list provided in txt file.
  User gets to choose difficulty level (3, 5 or 7 tries possible).
  If user guesses the word before running out of chances - he/she stays alive.
  Otherwise, the user becomes the Hangman.
  
**3. Password Generator**

  An app that allows user to randomly generate a string of 8-20 characters.
  User has the option to choose the inclusion of special characters, digits and uppercase letters.
  Generated passwords are stored in external txt file (not safe option - don't do it in real life! :) )
